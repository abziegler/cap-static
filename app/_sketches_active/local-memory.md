### CONTENT FIELDS ###
# (Markdown syntax acceptable!)

# Required
what_does_it_do: >
  Participatory archiving by local communities and libraries

# Optional
why_does_it_exist: |
  We see instances of participatory archiving around major, often traumatic community events, such as the [Boston Marathon](http://marathon.neu.edu/) and the [2011 Japan earthquate and tsunami](http://www.jdarchive.org/en/home). These are amazing resources built by and for those directly affected.

  Could we generalize from their approach, or something like it, to create something that would allow small communities to organize their images, words and ther media around local events, with the help of librarians in the community?
