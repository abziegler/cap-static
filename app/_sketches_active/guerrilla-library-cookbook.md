### CONTENT FIELDS ###
# (Markdown syntax acceptable!)

# Required
what_does_it_do: >
  A guide and resource for people who want to start their own free form library

# Optional
why_does_it_exist: |
  Libraries are often thought of as existing in static, immovable buildings. Recently however, people have started to set up free form libraries all over the world that defy convention. From mobile libraries that exist without a permanent location to centers of learning and innovation in activist spaces, libraries provide considerable benefits for the communities they serve.

  As such, the Guerrilla Library Cookbook aims to provide all the necessary information and resources needed for anyone to start their own free form library. It will ask the reader pertinent questions about their project, and will guide them from set-up, to wrap-up.
