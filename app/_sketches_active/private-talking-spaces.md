what_does_it_do: >
  Secure and private spaces for cell phone conversations

# Optional
why_does_it_exist: |
  The cell phone is essential to daily life. Phone interactions are usually silent, but occasionally people need to use their phones for vocal conversations. These vocal conversations are often as important as any other information exchange in the library and range from job interviews to collaborations with folks in remote locations to check-ins with parents.

  If we don’t provide spaces for these important conversations we force people to choose between two bad options – either divulge their sensitive information publicly and disturb those around them, or leave the library.
