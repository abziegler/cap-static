        <p>Harvard Law School invites applications for the Caselaw Access Project Fellowship, a one-year opportunity to explore technology that enhances access to and understanding of the law and improves access to justice. The Fellowship is open to justice-minded technologists and technology-minded lawyers seeking to make a positive impact at the intersection of technology and legal information.</p>

        <p>The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects/caselaw-access-project/">Caselaw Access Project</a> has produced a unique and nearly comprehensive structured dataset of all published American court decisions. During the Fellowship year, the Fellow will work with the lawyers, librarians and programmers in the Harvard Law School Library to identify discrete opportunities to enhance or apply the data produced by the Caselaw Access Project to advance justice. The Fellow will design, prototype and iterate on a technology project (or projects) that seeks to achieve this goal. The Fellow's work will reflect a bias in favor of action and experimentation, emphasizing committed code over planning, analysis and discussion. The Fellow will be expected to do his or her own technical work, but this opportunity promises active collaboration with, and feedback from, the Library, the Library Innovation Lab and the broader community of fellow travelers.</p>

        <p>During the Fellowship year, the Fellow will identify a discrete problem in the legal field and design, prototype and iterate on a technology-enabled solution. The Fellow's work throughout the year will reflect a bias in favor of action and experimentation, emphasizing committed code over planning, analysis and discussion. The Fellow will be embedded with the lawyers and programmers within the Library Innovation Lab and Developing Justice. And while the Fellow will be expected to do his or her own technical work, the opportunity promises active collaboration with, and feedback from, this community of fellow travelers.</p>
