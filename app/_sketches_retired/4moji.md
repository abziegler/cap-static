### CONTENT FIELDS ###
# (Markdown syntax acceptable!)

# Required
what_does_it_do: >
  Categorize and sort anything with just four emoji.

# Optional
why_does_it_exist: |
  Your relationship with a book is personal and unique. It can be difficult to describe this relationship in a way that’s both meaningful to you, but using common words that other readers might search for themselves. 4moji uses the restricted — but emotional — character set of emoji to create descriptions and connections that are memorable and findable. It creates a poetry of taxonomy.

## Introducing 4Moji

A new way to search and sort — by emoji!

![collection of emoji](4moji-point-1.png)

Emoji are a potentially powerful form of folksonomy — they cut across conventional language barriers and form a self-contained set of tags. In fact, emoji encourage thinking in tags, translating what we might think of as a “continuous” (or “de-quantized”) language image into a series of evocative (“quantized”) symbols. Using emoji as the basis for a folksonomy of books (or anything, really) helps build a discrete symbolic system of description, flexible enough to cover a significant emotional landscape, but limited enough to allow unexpected uses and connections.

## What we talk about when we talk about :heart:

Poetry is built out of limitations

It might seem strange to think of a taxonomy as poetry (or even as creative at all) but taxonomy is just shorthand description — a synecdoche that builds its whole out of its noteworthy parts. Our english word “love” has its dictionary definitions and its personal definitions, but the :heart: has no explicit definition. It can assume the meanings of “love” but it can also be used for ideas of friendship, warmth, romance, heartbeat, activity, and even redness or blood. Expressive poetry emerges from these limits of vocabulary. Emoji could form an explicit poetics of taxonomy.

## What do we want to do?

4Moji would be a way to collect these four-emoji ideograms from users, analyze and compare different ideograms for a similar target object, and allow searching and discovery of objects through single or combination emoji. What could you find when you search for :lightning bolt: or :star: or :syringe: or :cigarette::whale:? 4Moji potentially opens a descriptive world of taxonomy without imposing new, unfamiliar keywords or much new cognitive burden. It’s a way toward emotional discovery.
